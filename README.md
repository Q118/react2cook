## User-Story 🧑‍🍳 
```
AS a home-chef, 
I WANT an app that will save my recipes
SO THAT I can add, delete, and edit them.
WHEN I select a recipe to edit 
THEN I am presented with the current inputs to update.
WHEN I select add new
THEN I am presented with blank inputs to fill in.
WHEN I select search
THEN I am presented with the Results Page which allows me to filter for certain recipes.
WHEN I select to research the recipe
THEN I am taken to an external website. 
WHEN I select back to recipes
THEN I am returned to the main page.
```
